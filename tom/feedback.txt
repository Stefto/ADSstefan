ml04_irisClassifier:

for your 'for loop' you could also use this:
for i in range(0, 2):

Your code is very readable and easy to understand. kudos

ml05_SVMFaceRecognition

your print_faces was very cleanly and effectively done.
Your face recognition is pretty good :).

ML06_NBTinyLang

Your randomface is build in a easy and convenient way.
i really like how you show your current state (of the variables) and the end of each block.
Looks good to me all in all.

ML07_DTTitanic

no remarks, can't find anything to comment on.

ML10_Regression

A different approach than i took, but just as effective, if not more.
You might want to add some comments for read abillity later on.

side note: you're going to get a better grade than i do apparently ;)

ML12_kMeans

If you're practising coding it is a good idea to leave earlier code commented for future reference.
In a production zone you might not wanna do it.

i'm going to need your feedback for the next one, i completely screwed that one up XD.

ML13_final

wine:
different approach than i did.
I think your red dots don't show up because you of range function, i'm not sure tough.
overal looks good, i had not considered the sgdc classifier

heart disease:
why did you not try to use some other algorithms, like Naive bayes for example?
Tough i'm glad to see we ended up with the same result :p.

I hope this helps,
